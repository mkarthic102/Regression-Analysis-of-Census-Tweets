# Regression-Analysis-of-Census-Tweets

• Analyzed and cleaned real-time data pulled from the Twitter API and compiled 2000 tweets posted by the Census into a Pandas data frame, 
identifying key characteristics of each tweet (i.e. presence of media, number of hashtags, and more)
• Created logistic and linear regression models in R to identify important tweet attributes that lead to high engagement and build an 
effective social media strategy to increase the accessibility and transparency of Census data
